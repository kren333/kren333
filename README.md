Hi there!

My name is Kevin Ren and I am a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Statistics and Machine Learning with an Additional Major in Computer Science.

I have coded in the past with Python, Javascript, C, MySQL, and R. With these projects, I have gained experience with systems programming, functional programming, Machine Learning, and web application development. In the near future I hope to learn more about how to combine all of these interests into standalone applications while gaining professional experience in a corporate setting (and also making time for personal projects that I just find cool!). 

Feel free to reach out at renkevin9@gmail.com! I'm super interested in any internship or project opportunities regarding data science/analytics, ML engineering, and any other statistics/computer science-related fields out there.
