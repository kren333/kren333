Hi there!

My name is Kevin Ren and I am a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University majoring Statistics and Machine Learning, with an intended Additional Major in Computer Science.

I have coded in the past with R, Python, SQL, and C; in the near future I hope to learn more about and apply ML algorithms to my current projects. I'm both involved in some CMU-affiliated research projects as well as a few personal-interest projects.
